			<span>Putting aside the (arguably true) notion that J.R.R. Tolkien
				is among the most influential fantasy writers of all time, it 
				is worth mentioning the intent of his writing and what it was meant to
				represent. While it may seem presumptuous to impose a definition on 
				the intentions of another person, Tolkien's readers have a wealth of 
				published personal communications between Tolkien, his son, and his publisher
				that clearly outline an overarching purpose for the lore of Middle-Earth.

				In those letters and correspondences, Tolkien proposed the idea that he would
				endeavour to write a creation myth or extended mythos for the British Isles, which
				he felt possessed no real myths of their own. Being a philologist and student 
				of history, Tolkien was strongly influenced by the myth-building of Scandinavian
				cultures and traditional Biblical structures, both of which he borrowed heavily from. Much has been written on this subject,
				but I'd like to focus on the execution
