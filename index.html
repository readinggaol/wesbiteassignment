				<h4>An argument...</h4>
				<p>Putting aside the (arguably true) notion that J.R.R. Tolkien
					is among the most influential fantasy writers of all time, it 
					is worth mentioning the intent of his writing and what it was meant to
					represent. While it may seem presumptuous to impose a definition on 
					the intentions of another person, Tolkien's readers have a wealth of 
					published personal communications between Tolkien, his son, and his publisher
					that clearly outline an overarching purpose for the lore of Middle-Earth.
					<br><br>
					In those letters and correspondences, Tolkien proposed the idea that he would
					endeavour to write a creation myth or extended mythos for the British Isles, which
					he felt possessed no real myths of their own. Being a philologist and student 
					of history, Tolkien was strongly influenced by the myth-building of Scandinavian
					cultures and traditional Biblical structures, both of which he borrowed heavily from. Much has 
					been written regarding the inspiration of his writing, but I feel that not enough has been
					said regarding the effect of this very conscious decision.
					<br><br>
					Tolkien's distinctive narrative tone, defined primarily by its lofty language and sweeping
					prose, is to some degree a function of the material's intended purpose. The stories of 
					Middle-Earth are intended not only to entertain, but also to inspire and somehow to educate,
					both of which are commonly accepted functions of more "classical" myths and fables. To my eye,
					Tolkien's stories deserve to occupy a place in the literary canon closer to Odysseus and the Iliad
					than to Harry Potter. The intent of the story is to impart meaning and impact in a style that much more 
					resembles the Bible, Torah, or Quran. Comparisons like these might be controversial, but only in the
					sense that they are intrepreted by some to be denigrating towards the source material with the 
					larger following. However, in the same way that religious texts overlap in key, recurring areas, 
					Tolkien's work is no more derivative than any of the stories that share the same themes with it.
